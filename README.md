# Homelab?


A homelab is a personal setup where people create a small-scale IT environment at home. It’s like having a mini data center or computer network for experimenting, learning, or testing things. This mini data center consists of all hardware, software and networking equipment that resembles the original data center. An environment set-up to test, experience and learn new IT technologies and environments in their home. For setting up a homelab you don’t need to have advanced hardware and equipment, a old computer is enough!

## Why Homelab?
A homelab is basically a personal tech setup at home where you can learn, experiment, and build IT skills. It’s perfect for practicing things like networking, programming, cybersecurity, or managing servers in a safe and controlled environment. You can try out new software, test configurations, or mess around with tools without worrying about breaking anything important. It’s also great for building cool projects like hosting a website, running a game server, or setting up your own private cloud. If you’re looking to grow your career in IT or cybersecurity, a homelab is a fantastic way to get hands-on experience and show off your skills. “Think of it as your own little tech playground at home”.
## My Purpose
With an enthusiastic and eager mind for learning about servers and networking, I found the concept of a homelab incredibly fascinating, it felt like an evening snack for my brain. Initially, I started this homelab with no specific plans, but now I have exciting projects in mind. I’ve set up my own movie streaming platform, an attack box using Kali Linux, and a Docker environment running on an Ubuntu virtual machine. Having a personal lab offers numerous advantages, and the satisfaction of making everything work through my own efforts is truly rewarding.
## Goals
I want to understand the importance of a homelab and take my learning to the next level. Throughout my journey, I’ve enjoyed the process of making things work. With this homelab, I can create projects that not only help me learn but also enhance my home with innovative tech ideas, improved security features, and smarter access controls.
